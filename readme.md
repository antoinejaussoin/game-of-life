# The Game of Life

If you don't know what the Game of Life is yet, please look at the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

You can see this live [on my website](http://gol.jaussoin.com). I shall find a domain for that soon.

This version is using Svelte + Vite + TypeScript, but you can also find a React version in previous commits.
